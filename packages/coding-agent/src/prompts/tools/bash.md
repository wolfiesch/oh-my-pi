Runs commands in the embedded shell — terminal ops: git, bun, cargo, python.

# When to use bash — and when not to

The shell invokes **real binaries** with simple args. It is NOT full GNU Bash.

Use bash ONLY for: a single binary call, or one short pipeline that COMPUTES a fact and does not depend on shell-specific regex/quoting (`wc -l`, `sort | uniq -c`, `comm`, `diff`, a checksum, `git status`).
{{#if hasLaunch}}Long-running service, watcher, debugger, REPL, or process needing later input? MUST use `launch`, not bash.{{/if}}

{{#if hasEval}}Anything below → `eval` cell, not bash:
- Inline interpreter scripts (`-e`/`-c`/`--eval`) when an eval runtime exists for that language
- Heredocs (`<<EOF`), `while`/`for`/`if`/`case` shell control flow
- `$(…)` command substitution nested inside another command
- Pipelines with more than two stages, or stages that need control flow or quote/JSON escaping
- Multiline commands, `&&`-chains mixing control flow
- Quote/JSON escaping that fights the shell
{{else}}Anything below means you are writing a shell program, not invoking one. Prefer a purpose-built tool, a checked-in script, or a single repo command instead:

{{#if hasGrep}}- GNU grep BRE extensions are not guaranteed in the embedded shell: use `grep -E 'json|tool'` for alternation instead of `grep 'json\|tool'`; use the built-in `grep` tool with `pattern: "json|tool"` (Rust regex, so `\bword\b` works there){{#if hasEval}}, or `eval` for exact text processing{{/if}}.{{else}}- GNU grep BRE extensions are not guaranteed in the embedded shell: use `grep -E 'json|tool'` for alternation instead of `grep 'json\|tool'`{{#if hasEval}}, or use `eval` for exact text processing{{/if}}.{{/if}}

<instruction>
- `cwd` sets the working dir, not `cd dir && …`
- `env: { NAME: "…" }` for multiline / quote-heavy / untrusted values; reference `$NAME`
- Quote expansions (`"$NAME"`) to preserve exact content
- `pty: true` only when the command needs a real terminal (`sudo`, `ssh` needing input); default `false`
- `;` only when later commands should run despite earlier failures
- Multiple bash calls per message run concurrently. NEVER split order-dependent commands across parallel calls — chain with `&&` in one call.
- Internal URIs (`skill://`, `agent://`, …) auto-resolve to FS paths
{{#if hasEval}}- Need exact pipeline semantics (`cmd | head`, multi-stage filtering) or output truncation? Prefer `eval` and process the stream directly.{{else}}- Need exact pipeline semantics (`cmd | head`, multi-stage filtering) or output truncation?

{{#if asyncEnabled}}
- `async: true` defers reporting for finite commands that need no later input; completion arrives as a follow-up.

{{#if hasEval}}- The embedded shell invokes real binaries with simple args; it is NOT full GNU Bash and NOT a scripting surface. Loops, conditionals, heredocs, inline interpreter scripts (`-e`/`-c`/`--eval`) when an eval runtime exists, several piped stages, exact pipeline semantics, or quote/JSON escaping mean you're writing a program → use `eval` cells: restartable, stateful, and free of shell-quoting traps.{{else}}- The embedded shell invokes real binaries with simple args; it is NOT full GNU Bash and NOT a scripting surface.

{{#if hasGrep}}- NEVER shell out to search content or files: `grep/rg` → `grep`.{{else}}- Avoid shelling out for broad content search; use an active search/read tool when one is available.{{/if}}
{{#if hasRead}}{{#if hasGlob}}- NEVER use `ls` or `find` to list or locate files — `ls` → `read` (a directory path lists entries), `find` → the `glob` tool (globbing). This is non-negotiable, even for a single quick listing.{{else}}- Prefer `read` for known file and directory reads. Only use shell listing when no file-listing tool is active.{{/if}}{{else}}{{#if hasGlob}}- Prefer `glob` for file discovery; avoid `find` when `glob` is active.{{else}}- If no file read/listing tool is active, keep shell inspection narrow and state that limitation.{{/if}}{{/if}}
- Avoid head/tail/redirections: stderr already merged; long output auto-truncated, FULL capture kept at `artifact://<id>`.
{{#if hasLaunch}}- NEVER launch daemons, watchers, dev servers, debuggers, or REPLs through bash/background shell syntax — use `launch`.{{/if}}
</critical>

<output>
- Returns output (stderr merged into stdout); exit code shown on non-zero exit.
- Truncated output → `artifact://<id>` (linked in metadata).

{{#if asyncEnabled}}
# Timeout and async

- `timeout` is seconds; nonzero values are clamped to `1..3600` and the process is killed on elapse. Set `timeout: 0` only for finite commands whose completion is cancellation-owned.
- `async: true` defers only reporting; it does NOT extend a nonzero timeout.
{{#if hasLaunch}}- Need a service, watcher, debugger, REPL, or later stdin? MUST use `launch`. NEVER use `cmd &`, `nohup`, or async bash as a process supervisor.{{else}}- Need a long-running process or >3600s run? Use an external process supervisor; avoid detached shell jobs you cannot later observe or stop.{{/if}}
{{/if}}
{{#if autoBackgroundEnabled}}

## Auto-background

- A long-running foreground call may convert to a background job; the final result arrives as a follow-up tool call. NOT a failure — don't retry or wait synchronously.
- Need the result inline (e.g. piping into another command)? Raise `timeout` above expected duration{{#if asyncEnabled}}, or set `async: true` up front{{/if}}.
{{/if}}

# Output minimizer

- Long output truncated; test/lint runner output filtered to failures. When visible text changed, a `[raw output: artifact://<id>]` footer links the full capture — read it if a run looks suspicious or you need exact bytes.
- No footer = what you see is exactly what the command emitted.
