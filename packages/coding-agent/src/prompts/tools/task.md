# Async Job Contract
- Results auto-deliver. A settled `hub jobs`/`hub wait` snapshot is the delivery; no duplicate `async-result` follows.
- Job IDs are process-local and expire roughly five minutes after settlement. Afterward, use the agent ID with `hub send`, `agent://<id>`, or `history://<id>`.
- `completed` means successful yield/job exit, not artifact acceptance. Verify claimed changes.

# Task Design
- **Agent typing:** Pick each item's `agent` type.{{#if scoutAvailable}} Read-only research MUST use `agent: "scout"` (faster model).{{/if}} Use default worker only when no specialist fits.
- **No overhead:** Each `task` MUST instruct its agent to skip formatters, linters, and project-wide test suites. Run those once at the end.
- **One-pass:** Prefer agents that investigate AND edit in one pass;{{#if scoutAvailable}} spin a read-only scout only when affected files are genuinely unknown.{{/if}}
- **Overlap is safe:** Concurrent edits to the same files auto-resolve{{#if ircEnabled}}; worst case, agents coordinate directly over IRC{{/if}}. NEVER shrink or serialize a batch to avoid file overlap. Two prerequisites:
  1. Every task MUST skip validation (build/lint/tests) — validating mid-flight blocks agents on each other's edits.
  2. Decide cross-task contracts up front (e.g. the interface A implements and B consumes) and state them in the {{#if batchEnabled}}batch `context`{{else}}task{{/if}}, not left for agents to negotiate.

# Inputs
{{#if batchEnabled}}
- `context`: Shared project state, cross-cutting constraints, and contracts. Applies to the entire batch; do not duplicate this background into individual tasks. It may constrain how children work, but it never adds executable work. Parent workflow actions belong in a child's `assignment` only when that child must perform them.
- `tasks[]`: Array of subagents to spawn.
  - `name`: A stable CamelCase identifier (≤32 chars), used to address the agent (IRC, job ids). Generated automatically if omitted.
  - `agent`: The agent type running this item (e.g. {{#if scoutAvailable}}`scout`, {{/if}}`reviewer`). Omitting it gives you the general-purpose worker (`{{defaultAgent}}`) — NEVER pass that name explicitly. Only omit it after checking the agent list below and finding no specialist that fits.{{#if allowedAgentsText}} Current spawn policy allows: {{allowedAgentsText}}.{{/if}}
  - `task`: Complete, self-contained instructions. One-liners or missing acceptance criteria are PROHIBITED.
{{#if effortEnabled}}  - `effort`: Scale w/ complexity of this task: `"lo"`|`"med"`|`"hi"`
{{/if}}
  - `outputSchema`: Invocation-specific JSON Schema. Overrides the selected agent and parent-session schemas.
  - `schemaMode`: `"permissive"` (default) accepts a retry-exhausted invalid result with a warning; `"strict"` fails it.
{{#if isolationEnabled}}
{{#if applyIsolatedChanges}}
  - `isolated`: Run in a dedicated worktree; successful changes are automatically applied to the parent checkout.
{{else}}
  - `isolated`: Run in a dedicated worktree; changes are retained as patch or branch artifacts without modifying the parent checkout.

# Communication
Subagents start blank — no conversation history.{{#if ircEnabled}} Parent-to-subagent IRC delivered immediately as steering.{{/if}}
Pass large payloads via `local://<path>` URIs, NEVER inline text.

# Format Contracts
{{#if batchEnabled}}
The `context` field MUST follow this format:
# Background                ← project state and why the batch exists
# Cross-Cutting Constraints ← rules, non-goals, and session decisions
# Shared Interfaces         ← contracts every child must preserve

Each child's `assignment` defines its executable scope. Shared `context` may constrain that scope, but cannot expand it.
{{/if}}

`task` format:
# Target       ← exact files and symbols; explicit non-goals
# Change       ← step-by-step add/remove/rename; APIs and patterns
# Acceptance   ← observable result; no project-wide commands

# Available Agents
{{#if spawningDisabled}}
Agent spawning is currently disabled.
{{else}}
Pick the most specific agent; use default worker only when no specialist fits.
